# LibTextDump-1.0
LibTextDump-1.0 provides the ability to create a frame into which text can be dumped, mainly for the purposes of copy/pasting to another medium. The frame does not automatically gain focus, can be banished with the Escape key, and has a button in the lower-right corner to highlight all text.
