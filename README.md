# SpartanUI

SpartanUI (SUI) was originally designed to free your screen by moving a majority of the interface elements to the bottom. While that is still the core focus of the primary addon and configuration it has become much more. Spartan UI has become completely modular and has added many new features over the years. Thanks to the modules you can use only the parts of SUI that you want to give you untimate control over your interface.
