# SpartanUI todo

## High Priority Bugs

- Addon list window resizing does not work at all.

## Slider Trays

- Allow a user to select frames that will be hidden with the tray and allow skins to deine what frames are in a tray. Right now this is a single text box and is not user friendly.
  - I am thinking of a option system wher we have a group with custom list of elements and it shows the frames that are included. Similar to the voice lines in `StopTalking` for listing frames to hide/show with the tray.
  - This should also allow for easy visual identification of items added by the skin and the user can easily exclude them.

## New Theme Gale

- New version of Minimal Skin Called `Gale` with the actionbars together & minimap in top right, all the bars will be increased in scale to 1.1 size.
- The minimap will be about 1.3 times larger than normal with a dark border and a slight class color glow around it.
- Party and Raid Frames will be slightly larger in size with a power bar of 10 and health of 40 width of 110 the player name will be centered in the health bar.
- Party and Raid Frames should have a solid black background and a 1px border. this border should also be between the health and power bars.
- Player and Target frames will be wider 220 and narrower health height of 25, disable power text, the player name should be on the left side of the health bar and their total health with no abbreviation on the right side of the health bar. the text position will be oposite for the target frame.
- The order of bars will be inverted for player and target frames so that the power bar is on the top followed by the health bar below it and finally the castbar on bottom.
- The Threat glow will be enabled and glow around the entire frame.
- All Status icons will be placed outside of the health and power bars.
- `Gale` will use a solid black background on all bars with a Class border on the top of Bars 1, 3, 4
- Only action bars 1-4 & 6 will be used by default, 5 should be positioned to the left side of the screen but disabled
- Bars 1 and 2 will be Horizontaly stacked with #1 on top, bars 4 will be to the left and 3 to the right.
- the Pet Bar will be above Bar 1 Bar 6 will be Vertical on the right side of the screen.
- Pet Bar will need to be increased in size to match the new larger actionbars.
