# LibEditMode

This is a library addon for the popular MMORPG "World of Warcraft.

## Description

LibEditMode is a library that allows a developer to integrate their frames into the Edit Mode introduced in Dragonflight.

It has feature parity with the systems Blizzard added to the Edit Mode, but limits its re-use of methods to limit taint issues.
It depends on [LibDropDown](https://github.com/p3lim-wow/LibDropDown) to achieve this.

For details on how to implement this in your own addon, please see the wiki:
